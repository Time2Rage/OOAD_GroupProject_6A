        /* Tamara, Wallace and Ned decide to open a temp agency, since some of their friends struggle to find a job
        after the Corona Virus wiped a good margin of the jobs on the market. Now that everyone starts to hire again,
        but is still cautious about committing to long term contracts, they plan on keeping their friends going until
        everything is back to normal.

        Luckily Tamara is experienced in whipping up makeshift IT interfaces to get enterprises like this started.

        She set up this system, and adds herself as manager and admin
        Wallace and Ned as managers as well.

        Next the three invite all their friends to sign up.
        10 People instantly fill out their profiles, across various industries. (Using the file mockCV.txt as CV or null)

        All ready to go the 3 scurry out to find companies interested in taking on temporary contracts.
        Not all industries are exhausted, but a software company needs a short-term replacement for a colleague who
        dropped out of the company during a project launch.
